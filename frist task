# we climb into the table and compare the modulus of this value with the m distribution for 22 degrees of freedom
# turned out to be significant, with p-value < 0.001


cor.test(df$inbreeding.coefficient, df$pups)
# well, almost agreed, although here the p-value is slightly larger
# more spearman can be counted

cor.test(df$inbreeding.coefficient, df$pups, method = "spearman")
# also obtained significant differences, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis
Conclusion: inbreeding and the number of surviving puppies are negatively correlated values (significantly).
